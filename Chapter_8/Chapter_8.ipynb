    "Show that table-lookup TD($\\lambda$) is a special case of general TD($\\lambda$) as given by equations (8.5 - 8.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer__: We can represent the tabular setup by using a simple vector $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\lvert \\mathcal{S} \\rvert}$, such that $V_t(s_k) = \\theta_t(k)$. The $\\delta_t$ remains defined identically and the eligibility trace is now a vector of dimension ${\\lvert \\mathcal{S} \\rvert}$, containing the traces for all states $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$. From the definition of $V$, the gradient of $V_t(s_k)$ w.r.t $\\theta$ is a vector of zeros on all positions except in position $k$ where it is $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the update of $V$ after each step is replaced with identical results by simply updating the vector $\\theta$ according to equation (8.5), for all steps at once. So the general TD($\\lambda$) can easily represent a tabular TD($\\lambda$) with this simple convention."
